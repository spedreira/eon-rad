# Reverse Words

Implement a python function that reverses each word within a sentence.

For example: 'this is a normal sentence' should be converted to 'siht si a lamron ecnetnes'

## Scope

Add your implementation in `reverse_words.py` so that every test defined in `reverse_words_test.py` passes.


## Run tests

`nosetests reverse_words_test.py`
